    <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
    <p>Computer programming is the process of writing instructions that get executed by computers. The instructions, also known as code, are written in a programming language which the computer can understand and use to perform a task or solve a problem.</p>
    <p>Some of the programming languages include:</p>
    <p>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C and C++</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>c#</li>
    </p>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>If you want to learn how to code, taking your first steps into this huge universe might seem like a daunting, if not intimidating task. Here’s the big secret: There are plenty of free (and inexpensive) resources you can use to give yourself all the
        help you need, teach yourself new techniques, and make this learning process fun and exciting—as exciting as coding can get, at least.
    </p>
    <p>Whether you’re an adult looking to transition into the tech industry, a student looking to learn the latest language, or a hobbyist who just wants to understand how software and services work, all you need is a computer and internet access to start
        your programming journey. But before you take a flying leap into The Matrix, here are our best tips and resources to set you off on the right foot.
    </p>
    <h3>Ask yourself: Why do you want to learn how to code?</h3>
    <p>Take a few minutes (or a day) to think about the reasons—the real reasons—why you want to learn a programming language. Be honest with yourself. Are you trying to learn the barest minimum to score a promotion? Are you looking to make a big career
        change? Do you want to create the next greatest app? Thrill your roommates by programming your various smart devices to do something awesome?
    </p>
    <p>
    Your answer can help determine which programming language(s) you should master, as well as what sort of commitment (in time and money) your goal
     may require. For example, if your dream is to create the next great operating system or a killer alternative to PhotoShop , you would benefit 
     from a formal computer science education that teaches you C++,as well as more complex topics like data structure, algorithms and memory allocation.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the other hand, if you’re a mid-career professional looking to transition into a tech career, a short-term coding bootcamp might make more 
    sense than going into debt for a second degree. If all you want to do is build websites or push your Raspberry Pi to its limits,
    a combination of interactive tutorials and free online courses might be enough to get you going.
